# Experimental Spotify client, in Elm.
IMPORTANT : At this moment, Beardify works like a remote controller for Spotify, you will need to have an official client launched in the background. It's an alpha version, only add/remove albums in collections, play songs/albums, view and play your playlists and view Spotify data.

## Installation
Don't try to install it, otherwise your house will probably explode, and so will your dog. Be patient, and when it's ready I'll make smoke signals in the sky, watch for a bear symbol in the clouds.

## To-Do for v1
- Cleaner Spotify authentication
- Improve reactivity of the player
- Rearrange order of playlists
- Home page
- Add/Delete/modify playlists/tracks
- Routes

## Features
- Elm 0.19 Ready
- Responsive
- Fast
- Added __Collections__, which are playlists containing keywords in the title (`#Collection`), which lists the albums it contains rather than a list of songs. 
- Adding a list of __associated videos__ on an artist's page
- Added a list of __useful links__ about the artist (Wikipedia, Sputnik, LastFM, Discogs...)

## Future features
- Publicly share collections
- More sources for releases
