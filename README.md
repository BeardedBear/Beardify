# Experimental Spotify client, in Elm.
IMPORTANT : Read-only for now

## Installation
Don't try to install it, otherwise your house will probably explode, and so will your dog. Be patient, and when it's ready I'll make smoke signals in the sky, watch for a bear symbol in the clouds.

## To Do
- Cleaner Spotify authentication
- Improve reactivity of the player
- Logo
- Paging playlists
- Home page
- Releases page
- Add/Delete/modify playlists/tracks
- Routes

## Features
- Elm 0.19 Ready
- Added __Collections__, which are playlists containing keywords in the title (`#C` or `#Collection`), which lists the albums it contains rather than a list of songs. 
- Adding a list of __associated videos__ on an artist's page
- Added a list of __useful links__ about the artist (Wikipedia, Sputnik...)

## Future features
- Publicly share collections
